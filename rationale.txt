Implementation description
--------------------------
Server spawns go routine for each url passed in query.
Routines send GET requests to given hosts and communicate results by channel.
Routines do not send anything to channel when error occurs.
In separate go routine server observes result channel until time out passes.
Results are then aggregated, filtered and sorted.

Additionally Makefile, test and build scripts were provided. Unit tests for critical functions, with happy path
and at least one case for errors.

Ambiguities
-----------
Specification does precise how endpoint errors and timeouts should be handled. It was assumed in such case,
go routine should log error and do not send anything to channel
Specification does not precise how incorrect query parameters should be handled. It was assumed,
warning should be reported in case where at least one proper parameter was provided, url passed correctly is send for processing,
error should be reported whenever whole query is incorrect. No processing done in this case.
